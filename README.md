# Nifm

This is the Nix Inspired File Manager.

It manages your files for you. 
It is designed to be able to have a dynamic file structure without having to move around the locations of files in storage. 
Works on all tested Linux distros.


Placing a `nifm.nix` into a parent directory and adding it to nifm using `nifm add .` will make nifm manage the files within that directory.
